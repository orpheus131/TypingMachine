# Typing Machine

## 1. Problem Statement

Our task is to implement typing machine using doubly linked list data structure. It is just
typical typing machine which can be found in many editors.
This typing machine has 3 features:
* moving cursor,
* inserting/deleting characters near cursor,
* and printing whole string.

You will implement 2 classes:
*  class **Node**, which is each node of linked list.
*  class **TypingMachine**, which is typing machine with features.

## 2. Implementation

### 2.1 class Node

We will implement Node type denoting each node of linked list.

                +----------+---------Node-Type---------+-----------+
                | Previous |                           |    Next   |
            <---+--        |  Internal char type data  |         --+--->   
                |   Node   |                           |    Node   |
                +----------+----------------------------+----------+


One public constructor and five public functions should be implemented.
* **explicit Node(char data)**: This constructor should make Node storing data as internal
data.
* **char GetData()**: This function should return internal data.
* **Node* InsertPreviousNode(char data)**: This function should make new Node with
given data and Insert between previous node and this node. (with new keyword of C++)
This function should return pointer of inserted node.
* **Node* InsertNextNode(char data)**: This function should make new Node with given
data and Insert between next node and this node. (with new keyword of C++) This
function should return pointer of inserted node.
* **Node* GetPreviousNode()**: This function should return set previous node with Insert-
PreviousNode method. If not set, this function should return nullptr.
* **Node* GetNextNode()**: This function should return set next node with InsertNextNode.
If not set, this function should return nullptr.
* **bool ErasePreviousNode()**: This function should erase previous node and deallocate.
(with delete keyword of C++) If previous node does not exist so erase was unsuccessful,
you should return false. Otherwise, you should return true.
* **bool EraseNextNode()**: This function should erase previous node and deallocate. (with
delete keyword of C++) If next node does not exist so erase was unsuccessful, you should
return false. Otherwise, you should return true.

Making another private functions or members are free. It is NOT recommended to use
global variables. You can verify correctness of this class Node with judging system.

### 2.2 class TypingMachine

We will implement TypingMachine type denoting whole typing machine.
One public constructor and seven public functions should be implemented.

* **TypingMachine()**: Initialize new Typing Machine
* **void HomeKey()**: Move cursor at the beginning of the line.
* **void EndKey()**: Move cursor at the end of the line.
* **void LeftKey()**: Move cursor one step left.
* **void RightKey()**: Move cursor one step right.
* **bool TypeKey(char key)**: Insert key at the left of the cursor. This typing machine only
accept key in ASCII range 32 (0x20, ` ') through 126 (0x7E, `~'), inclusive. If element
is out of range, you should do nothing. If you inserted a character, this function should
return true, otherwise return false.
* **bool EraseKey()**: Erase a character at the left of the cursor. If it does not exist, do
nothing. If you erased a character, this function should return true, otherwise return
false.
* **std::string Print(char separator)**: Return typed string in typing machine. You
should put separator to the place where cursor exists. If separator is 0 (NUL char-
acter), you should not display the cursor.

Function **LeftKey, RightKey, EraseKey** should do nothing if there does not exist target of
function.

**Maximum length of string in machine is 100.** If there are already length 100 string
in machine, TypeKey should do nothing and rejected.
